**Multena Proxy** is a multi-tenancy ready tool designed to enhance the authorization capabilities of your LGTM (Loki
Grafana Tempo Mimir(Prometheus Style API / OpenMetrics)) stack. Built with LBAC (Label Based Access Control) at its
core.

Multena provides secure and granular user authorization based on assigned tenant labels.
It integrates seamlessly with PrometheusAPI and Loki, and
should support generic oauth provider for identity management. With features like ConfigMap-based configuration,
flexible authorization providers, and multiple tenant labels, Multena ensures that the right data is accessible to the
right users.

---
> __NOTE:__ Multena was initially developed to support OpenShift 4's internal Prometheus, which is powered by Thanos.
> As a result, many references in Multena are made to Thanos, which serves as an API following the Prometheus style.

## How does it work?

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Receive Request] -->|Extract Token| B{Get OAuth Token?}
    B -->|Error| E[Deny Request]
    D -->|Error| E
    D -->|Valid & Not Skip| G{Enforce Query?}
    D -->|Valid & Skip| F[Stream Up to Upstream and End]
    B -->|Success| D{Validate Labels?}
    G -->|Error| E
    G -->|Success| F

```

In summary, here's how Multena works:

1. Multena receives a request.
2. Multena performs an authorization check in the form of a JWT token validation.
3. If the user is not authorized, Multena denies the query without further processing.
4. If the user is authorized, Multena examines which labels corrispond to the user.
5. If the user has no labels, Multena denies the query without further processing.
6. if the user has labels and its skip (e.g., cluster wide access), it will forward the request to the upstream server
   without further processing.
7. If the user has labels, and it's not a skip, Multena checks if the values in the label match in the query are allowed
   for the user.
8. If the values are not allowed, Multena dienies the request without further processing.
9. If there are no label matches for the tenant label (e.g., namespace), Multena will append the allowed labels to the
   query.
10. If the values are allowed, Multena forwards the query to the specific endpoint or service responsible for processing
    the query.
11. Multena streams the response from the upstream server to the client.

By performing authorization checks, label matching, appending labels, Multena ensures that
users can only query data they are authorized to access.

## Deploy Multena

The helm chart for Multena is available
at [gp-helm-charts](https://github.com/gepaplexx/gp-helm-chart-development/tree/develop/infra/gp-multena)

To install run the following commands:

```bash 
helm repo add gepardec https://gepaplexx.github.io/gp-helm-charts/
helm install multena gepardec/gp-multena -n <grafana-namespace>
```

To upgrade, run the following commands:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade multena gepardec/gp-multena -n <grafana-namespace>
```

> **_NOTE:_** If your using the grafana operator, the helm chart provides an option to install
> grafana-operator-datasources
> which simplifies the deployment of Multena. If you deploy Multena without the grafana-operator-datasources you have to
> configure the datasource manually.

# Configuring Multena

## Labelstore Providers

> **_NOTE:_** Currently Multena offers two different providers for label lookup, namely ConfigMap and MySQL.

### ConfigMap Provider

With the ConfigMap provider, Multena can retrieve labels by reading a separate ConfigMap that defines a list of
allowed labels for each user or group. This approach allows for easy configuration and management of label permissions
by specifying the allowed labels directly in the ConfigMap. An example can be found
here [labels.yaml](./configs/labels.yaml)

You can define the allowed labels for groups and users manually, but if you deploy multena in a single cluster, we
recommend
to use the [multena-rbac-collector](https://github.com/gepaplexx/multena-rbac-collector) to continuesly collect the
permissions
for each user and group. This tool will create a labels.yaml file which can be directly used by Multena.
To enable it set, the following setting

```yaml
rbac-collector:
  enabled: true 
```

in the helm chart.

### MySQL Provider

The MySQL provider enables label lookup through executing a custom
query against a MySQL database. This capability allows Multena to dynamically fetch the allowed tenant lalbel (e.g.,
namespace)
for a specified email or user or groups. By setting the appropriate query in the configuration, Multena can seamlessly
retrieve
the relevant label information from the MySQL database.

This makes only sense if you already have a MySQL database with a systematic way to get the permissions for a user.

> **_NOTE:_** As every query sends a query to the database, we recommend enabling caching for the database.

### config.yaml

#### proxy section

```yaml
web:
  proxy_port: 8080 # port on which the proxy will listen
  metrics_port: 8081 # port on which the metrics will be exposed
  host: localhost # host on which the proxy will listen
  tls_verify_skip: true # skip tls verification for the upstream server, very insecure!!!
  trusted_root_ca_path: "./certs/" # path to the trusted root ca
  label_store_kind: "configmap" # kind of label store, currently only configmap and mysql are supported
  jwks_cert_url: https://sso.example.com/realms/internal/protocol/openid-connect/certs # url to the jwks certificate
  oauth_group_name: "groups" # name of the group field in the jwt token
```

#### datasource section (thanos|loki)

```yaml
thanos|loki: # choose either thanos or loki
url: https://localhost:9091 # url to the thanos or loki endpoint     | Required
tenant_label: namespace # label which is used to enforce the query   | Required
cert: "./certs/thanos/tls.crt" # path to the mtls certificate        | Optional
key: "./certs/thanos/tls.key" # path to the mtls key                 | Optional
Header: # headers which will be added to the request                 | Optional
  X-Scope-OrgID: "application"

```

#### logging section

```yaml
log:
  level: 1 # log level, 0 = debug, 1 = info, 2 = warn, 3 = error, -1 = trace exposes sensitive data!!!
  log_tokens: false # logs jwt, expose sensitive data!!!
```

#### admin section

```yaml
admin:
  bypass: true # enable bypassing the enforcing steps
  group: gepardec-run-admins # group which is allowed to bypass the enforcing steps
```

#### db section

```yaml
db:
  enabled: false # enable connection to a database
  user: multitenant # username for the database
  password_path: "." # path to the password for the database (kubernetes secret)
  host: localhost # host of the database
  port: 3306 # port of the database
  dbName: example # name of the database
  query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?" # query to retrieve data from the database, must return a list of labels
  token_key: "email|username|groups" # field in the jwt which will be used to query the database 
```

### labels.yaml

The `labels.yaml` file is used to define the allowed labels for groups and users in Multena. It follows a specific YAML
format as shown below:

```yaml
group1:
  '#cluster-wide': true # this grants the group to skip enforcement
user1:
  hogarama: true # single namespace
user3:
  grafana: true # multi namespace
  opernshift-logging: true
  opernshift-monitoring: true
```

The format consists of a key for username|groupname, followed by another key value pair where the key
is the label and value is true.
This has been done to look up the labels faster.

## How to Configure Multena Proxy

### Step 1: Install/Upgrade Multena Using Helm

Multena can be deployed using its Helm chart. Execute the following commands to install or upgrade Multena:

To **install**:

```bash
helm repo add gepardec https://gepaplexx.github.io/gp-helm-charts/
helm install multena gepardec/gp-multena -n <grafana-namespace>
```

To **upgrade**:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade multena gepardec/gp-multena -n <grafana-namespace>
```

> **Note**: When using the Grafana operator, the Helm chart provides an option to install `grafana-operator-datasources`
> to simplify the deployment of Multena. If you deploy it without the `grafana-operator-datasources`, you'll have to
> configure the datasource manually.

### Step 2: Choose a Labelstore Provider

Multena offers two types of providers for label lookup - **ConfigMap** and **MySQL**.

#### a. ConfigMap Provider

- Utilizes a separate ConfigMap to define allowed labels for each user/group.
- Labels can be defined manually, or use [multena-rbac-collector](https://github.com/gepaplexx/multena-rbac-collector)
  for automatic collection of permissions.

To enable the use of multena-rbac-collector in the Helm chart:

```yaml
rbac-collector:
  enabled: true 
```

#### b. MySQL Provider

- Performs a custom query against a MySQL database to retrieve allowed tenant labels dynamically for a specified
  user/group.
- Suitable if you have a systematic way to retrieve permissions for a user via a MySQL database.

> **Note**: Enable caching for the database since every query sends a request to it.

### Step 3: Configure `config.yaml`

Multena's `config.yaml` contains crucial configuration sections such as `proxy`, `datasource`, `logging`, `admin`,
and `db`.

#### a. Proxy Section

Define configurations like proxy port, host, TLS verification, and OAuth group name here.

#### b. Datasource Section (Thanos/Loki)

Specify either `thanos` or `loki` and define configurations like URL, tenant label, certificate paths, and headers.

#### c. Logging Section

Manage log level and token logging here.

#### d. Admin Section

Configure if and which group can bypass enforcing steps.

#### e. DB Section

Enable and configure database connections, define query parameters, and specify which JWT field will be used to query
the database.
